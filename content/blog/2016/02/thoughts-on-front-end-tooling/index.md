![choices](images/choices-1.jpg) Being a front-end developer means keeping up with current trends. It doesn't mean you have to master them all, however you are expected to know what's available. It's a tough job.

## Out with the old, in with the new (?)

We are surrounded by an ever increasing number of tools, libraries and frameworks. The [paradox of choice](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en) kicks in regularly in my day to day decisions.

You could, of course, Google and see what everyone else is doing. Personally, I find it quite daunting. When picking, for example, a framework, people tend to become very dogmatic and the end result is nothing more than a shallow clickbait.

New technologies arrive to serve a purpose. Understanding the problems they solve is more important than the tool itself since it will, eventually, change or evolve.

## Questions yourself

When making a choice, try to answer yourself these questions: **Why am I using X instead of Y?** How much of this is a personal choice rather than professional? Am I following a trend?

**What is X giving me that makes my job easier?** Is the learning curve too steep for you and your team? How does it integrate with other systems? Can it be automated?

**Do I know what X is doing behind the scenes or am I happy to treat it as a blackbox?** Maybe the scope of the tool is too deep for my level or it crosses the border of the work I'm supposed to be doing.

## Conclusion

Asking myself those questions helps me clear my head and focus on my initial problem. This is especially true after browsing for a while and going through dozens of articles.

In the end, more tools means more choices. See what applies to you, your team and, specially, your problem.
