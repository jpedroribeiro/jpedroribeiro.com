Once again [Start Your Shift](https://twitter.com/hashtag/startYourShift) brought me another puzzling topic to write about: Web Ethics.

## It's in the news

It took me a while to come up with a subject to talk about under the umbrella that is _ethics_. The one that stood out to most, possibly due to [recent events](http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/), was privacy.

And this is not restricted to the tech section anymore. It is now part of the main headlines.

## Ethics in Development

I see privacy as a subset of security. When you build a website, your user base is expected to interact and leave _traces_ of their private data around, be it in form of shared cookies or through a form submission.

It doesn't take long to see examples of **bad practices**. I've lost count of how many websites would send my password in plain text via e-mail. Or the e-commerce website who would expect me to type my payment details on their checkout without [SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security). These companies are not being ethical with their customers and took the lazy route - putting security and privacy as a second class citizen.

Your job as a developer is to make sure that the form goes through a secure connection and the data you stored in a cookie is properly encrypted. Not as a _nice_ feature to have, but as a **requirement**.

## Helping the users

Not all your users are going to be tech-savvy enough to know the dangers of leaving data around. Not even seasoned engineers can predict all the different scenarios so don't expect others to do it.

Being more **empathetic** about your client's privacy is a step forward to ensure your website is behaving ethically towards them.

## The Shift

This post is part of the [#startYourShift](https://twitter.com/hashtag/startyourshift) initiative where everyone is invited to write about different topics each month.
