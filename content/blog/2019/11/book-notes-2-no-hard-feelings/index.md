A mixture of _self-help_ and _workplace_ guide, [No Hard Feelings: Emotions at Work and How They Help Us Succeed ](https://amzn.to/33ldStz), by Liz Fosslien  & Mollie West Duffy, is a must have for anyone trying to understand and deal with a typical office workplace.  

Not only the content is engaging but the **illustrations** are so spot-on that makes the chapters fly like a conversation. Another **5-star** rating on [my GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186522-j-pedro-ribeiro).  

Here are my _highlights_: 

1. "In modern business, collaboration is next to godliness". But the downside to more collaboration is more conflict. `(p.11)`
2. Success depends on learning how to let emotion into the workplace without letting it run wild. By confronting our envy, we learn what drives us. `(p.11)`
3. You can also try a technique called **reappraisal** [...] reframing their stress as excitement. `(p.38)`
4. **Nothing diminishes anxiety faster than action.** `(p.44)`
5. Ask your manager to define outcome rather than processes. `(p.56)`
6. Ordinary, incremental progress makes us happier and more engaged. `(p.56)`
7. Ask open-ended questions [...] "How might we...". `(p.56)`
8. The opportunity to **level up** is largely driven by you, by what you choose to absorb, by who you choose to learn from. `(p.62)`
9. (On asking for a raise) "I don't want my salary to be a distraction to me while I am in this role". `(p.98)`
10. Ask **what** not **why**: **Why** questions stir up negative emotions; **what** questions keep us curious. `(p.101)`
11. Don't rely on emotions (when making decisions). `(p.104)`
12. In a study of married couples, those who remain calm during arguments are the happiest and longest lasting. `(p.141)`
13. **Diversity** is having a seat at the table, **inclusion** is having a voice, and **belonging** is having that voice be heard. `(p.185)`
14. Employees who do not switch from "I" to "we" during the first 6 months are more likely to leave. `(p.190)`
15. The best managers are **shit umbrellas**. When the shit hits the fan, they do what they can to protect their team form the emotional fallout. `(p.213)`
