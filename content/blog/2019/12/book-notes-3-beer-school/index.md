Written by the folks from very entertaining YouTube channel [The Craft Beer Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCraftBeerChannel/videos), the book functions both as an _introduction_ to beer and for the novice on the subject as well as a further _education_ for someone who already got their basis sorted.    

The book is filled with **illustrations** that help guide you through the more complex topics and beautiful **photos** that set the scene and ambiance of the journey. All wrapped in a writing that is informal and fun, like a chat with friends at your local pub. This is, yet, another **5-star** rating on [my GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186522-j-pedro-ribeiro).    

Here are my _highlights_: 

1. Two-row (barley) is **best** because the proteins and starch are more evenly distributed, making it a more predictable grain to malt and brew with. `(p.25)`
2. Pilsner mal is bready, sweet and slightly honey. `(p.29)`
3. (Crystal malt) is commonly used in **American IPAs** to balance all the hop bitterness. `(p.30)`
4. Wheat is used to give beers more body and a subtle sweetness. `(p.34)`
5. Once water has been heated up in a brewery, it is no longer known as water. **It becomes liquor**. `(p.48)`
6. The hardness of the water refers to the concentration of calcium and magnesium. `(p.49)`
7. (On Citrah hops) is one of the **most sought-after and expensive** varieties in the world. `(p.61)`
8. The earlier you add a hop, the more bitterness it will impact. The opposite is true for aroma. `(p.68)`
9. (On bitterness) much like spice [...] we slowly build resistance to it. `(p.75)`
10. (On yeast) it gives off three key biproducts: **alcohol, carbon dioxide and esters**. `(p.78)`
11. The colder something is the less your palate can break down the flavours, so **drinking a beer slightly warmer** will open it up and let the aromas and flavours really shine. By the same token, **high carbonation** can be a little distracting on the palate, so a less carbonated beer is easier to dissect. `(p.99)`
12. (On carbonated beer) if you've got a hoppy beer screaming tropical fruit, a **keg** is going to do it more justice. `(p.99)`
13. (On serving beer cold) Malt flavours seem bright, the alcohol sweetness is more balanced and the bitterness is less tannic. `(p.101)`
14. (On retro-nasa appreciation) Breathing out after drinking can bring all kind of aromas back in **sharper focus**, as well as create the fullest sense of a beer. `(p.136)`
