If I would sum up this book in a short sentence it would be **"numbers don't like but liars use numbers"**. 

It's a class on **data interpretation**, and how biased or deceitful charts and graphs can be without the proper context.

Not a *fun* read, but eye-opening. A **4-star** rating on [my GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186522-j-pedro-ribeiro).    

Here are my _highlights_: 

1. (On sword swallowing) "Young doctor, don't you know that the throat is flat? You can only slide flat things down there. That is why we use a sword". `(p.2)`
2. There is no gap (between rich and poor countries). Today, most people, 75%, live in the middle-income countries. `(p.28)`
3. We almost always get a **more accurate picture** by digging a little deeper and looking not just at the average but at **the spread**: not just the group all bundle together, but the individuals. Then we often see that apparently **groups are in fact very much overlapping**. `(p.42)`
4. More **bad news** is sometimes due to better surveillance of suffering, not a worsening world. `(p.74)`
5. People often glorify their early experiences, and nations often glorify their histories. `(p.74)`
6. Now that parents have reason to expect that all their children will survive, a major reason for having big families is gone. `(p.92)`
7. (On graph shapes) Don't assume straight lines. Many trends do not follow straight lines [...]. No child ever kept up the **rate of growth** it achieve in its first six months, and no parents would expect it to. `(p.100)`
8. Critical thinking is aways difficult, but it's almost impossible when we are scared. **There's no room for facts when our minds are occupied by fear**. `(p.103)`
9. The world seems scarier than it is because what you hear about it has been selected - by your own attention filter or by the media. `(p.123)`
10. "I had for some time been appalled by the systematic blaming of **climate change** on China and India based on *total* emissions per nation. It was like claiming that obesity was worse in China than US because the total bodyweight of the Chinese population was higher than of the US population. `(p.140)`
11. Whether measuring HIV, GDP, mobile phones sales, internet users, or CO2 emissions, a **per capita** measurement will almost always be more meaningful. `(p.141)`
12. "When I see a **lonely number** in a news report, it always triggers an alarm: What should this number be compared to? What was that number a year ago? Ten years ago? What is it in a comparable country or region? And what should it be divided by? What is the total of which this is a part? What would this be per person? I compare the rates, and only then do I decide whether it really is an important number". `(p.142)`
13. Compare: big numbers always look big. `(p.143)`
14. When something goes wrong don't look for an individual or a group to blame. Accept that **bad things can happen** without anyone intending them to. `(p.222)`
15. **Give the system some credit**. When someone claim to have caused something good, ask whether the outcome might have happened anyway, even if that individual had done nothing. `(p.222)`
