Back in April, I've managed to book a short hiking trip to **Lake District** - by far my favorite place in the UK. We hiked the [Helvellyn mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvellyn), but that's a story for another post.

Lake District is home to a few breweries including [Keswick Brewery Company](https://keswickbrewery.co.uk/), [Jennings Brewery](https://www.jenningsbrewery.co.uk/), and [Hawkshead Brewery](http://www.hawksheadbrewery.co.uk/) which I manged to visit in this trip.

## The Brewery

Hawkshead Brewery was founded in 2002, producing mostly _real ale_ ([cask conditioned beer](https://www.camra.org.uk/beer/learn-more/beer-styles/)) alongside some keg conditioned beers.

They're relatively a local brewery, producing about _23.000 liters_ of beer a week and selling mostly in the North of England. Although I have not yet found them in London, I'm sure they're available in specialty bottle shops.

This was my third trip to the Lake District and the first time I was made aware of them, so I had to stop for a pint in their taproom.

## The Beers

We arrived at the taproom after hiking for hours (have I mentioned Helvellyn?), so we **needed** a refreshing, fizzy, thirst-quenching beer. And we found it:

> **Bay of Dreams** is an american style _wheat beer_ with roasted citrus fruits and fresh bay leaves.

It was everything we needed. At 4.5% ABV, it is very drinkable, has great body and mouthfeel, slightly hazy (check the picture above) and has just about the right amount of fruit/citrus notes.

They have a great set of small batch beers all begging to be tasted. From sours to coffee porters. Sadly, no gose (one of my favourite styles) was available on that day, maybe next time.

## Conclusion

If you find yourself in Lake District you simply have to stop by this lovely taproom. Hawkshead taproom is just a [short bus ride away](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hawkshead+Brewery+%26+The+Beer+Hall/@54.377432,-2.8164587,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487c92e850fe4a0f:0xb1d784963c5f3f30!8m2!3d54.377432!4d-2.81427) from popular towns like Windermere and Keswick.
