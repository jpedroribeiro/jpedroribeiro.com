This weekend I had the privilege to attend the biggest ReactJS conference in the world - [React Amsterdam](https://react.amsterdam/).

## Day 1 - Meetup Fail

My trip started on the wrong foot. I was planning to attend the GraphQL Community Meetup, but my flight got slightly **delayed** and I ended up missing it. To be fair, it's entirely my fault as I was _way_ too optimistic with the time it would take from landing at Schiphol Airport to getting all the way to the city centre, specially going through the immigration queues.

## Day 2, part 1 - The Workshop

One of the things that attracted me to this conference was the chance of attending workshop with top class developers in different fields.

The one I attended was the **GraphQL Workshop** with [Kitze](https://kitze.io/), beautifully located at the [Royal Industrieele Groote Club](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Royal+Industrieele+Groote+Club/@52.3724914,4.8933255,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c609c731728e8b:0xe01a4e4dd9accd2f!8m2!3d52.3724914!4d4.8933255).

Apart from a few issues with the lack of chargers and slightly cramped room, the workshop was excellent. Kitze managed to get a room filled with developers with different backgrounds and experience levels working with server side [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) in no time.

Personally, I'd rather spend more time on that area, but the agenda for the day was quite busy so we quickly moved to client side GraphQL, from barebones fetch to libraries like [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/).

## Day 2, part 2 - The Meetup (again, this time for real)

Just after the workshop, there was another meetup happening - The Official React Amsterdam Pre-party Meetup. Which I manage to attend this time.

This was a classic meetup format: free pizzas, networking and presentations. We heard from [Alessio Di Crescenzo](http://www.alessiodicrescenzo.com/) talking about his project React-Imago3d, and [Jessica Leach](https://twitter.com/jessicaleach6) telling us all about ReactJS lifecycle methods.

## Day 3 - The Conference

I was happily impressed by the quality of the speakers. This is the first conference that I attend where **every**, **single**, **talk** was great. I took so many notes I might need a day off to sort them out.

The highlights (and this was hard to pick) were [Sid](https://twitter.com/siddharthkp) walking us through how to refactor your ReactJS applications and get rid of _code smells_, followed by [Elizabet Oliveira](https://twitter.com/miuki_miu) who showed us the power of combining SVGs with React. She also _freestyled_ mid presentation which was simply awesome.

There was also a party with open bar, food, DJs, etc., and of course they had their own beer - React Blonde, brewed by [Brouwerij de Prael](https://www.deprael.nl/)

## Conclusion

Every conference has its own issues and React Amsterdam wasn't an exception. Food was a bit of a problem, queuing was another, but honestly, these things don't take the shine away from the organizers who clearly put a lot of effort and managed to create a brilliant conference.

I, for one, will be looking forward to next edition.
