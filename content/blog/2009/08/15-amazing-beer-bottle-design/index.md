[![15 Amazing Beer Bottle Designs](images/15-amazing-beer-bottle-design.jpg "15 Amazing Beer Bottle Designs")](http://jpedroribeiro.com/2009/08/15-amazing-beer-bottle-design/)

From all the different fields of **print design** the one that always gets my attention is the **beer bottles** design. It's a saturated market and all brands want to attract their consumers. To **stand out** from other packages in the shelf, the design has to be very creative. Here I've made a selection of 15 beer bottles, labels and packaging design that will inspire you to design outside the box and make your work stand out. Cheers!
