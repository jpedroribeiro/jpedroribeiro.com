**Vintage** \- or Retro - design is the style that uses techniques, colours or shapes used in the past. I am a big fan of this style and in this post I am going to point out some of the best **websites** to find great vintage material - from illustrations and photos to tutorials and resources.

## Flickr

Flickr has an extensive selection of **vintage** and retro material. I've selected 2 of them which I use as inspiration for some design pieces.
