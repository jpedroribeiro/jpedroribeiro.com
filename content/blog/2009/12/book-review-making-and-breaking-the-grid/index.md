_Making and Breaking the Grid_, by **[Timothy Samara](http://www.facebook.com/people/Timothy-Samara/664131846)**, is an analysis of the construction and deconstruction of **grid-based designs**. Featuring a comprehensive showcase of works in different media and across several decades.

## The Book

[The book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Breaking-Grid-Layout-Workshop/dp/1592531253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260631305&sr=8-1) is basically divided into 2 parts. The first one about the **creation** of the grid-based designs and its usage. The second one explains the **deconstruction** of the grid, a different approach on design in which the grid doesn't have to **obey any rules**. In the first few pages the reader will be immersed into the historical facts surrounding the development of the grid-based design. There is a lot of information here - about 150 years of **art & design** evolution in only 7 pages - maybe a timeline would be interesting. But then again, this is not a history book.

The next chapter the **author** slows down the pace and starts a _workshop_ about grid design. The content here is precise, clear enough for **beginners** and a good read for **advanced** designers. Concepts and styles are illustrated in a simple yet effective way and the examples are spot on.

Then the showcase begins. Pages and pages of great **artwork** from different decades and styles. Each of them with its own grid style - column, modular grid, etc. Description and comments explain how it was used and the effect generated by it.

## Conclusion

As an introduction to grid-design, _Making and Breaking the Grid_ does its job. It will give the initial hints and ideas of **layout** structure in a few pages but doesn't go very deep. The highlight of the [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Breaking-Grid-Layout-Workshop/dp/1592531253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1260631305&sr=8-1), without any doubt, is the showcase of designs. Big illustrations and photographs with detailed information. Definitely a must-have on any [designer library](http://jpedroribeiro.com/tag/books/).
