**Typography** is a field that is quite new to me. Coming from a developer background, I did not study type the way graphic designers do. Luckily, today we have [great books](http://jpedroribeiro.com/2009/07/book-review-thinking-with-type/) and various websites approaching this subject.

In this post series, which will be called _Know Your Type_, I will share some basic concepts and theories to introduce you to the amazing world of typography.

In this first post, let's find out the main **terms** used to describe specific shapes used in the characters formation and their surroundings. These terms will be repeated throughout the posts in this blog series so you can always used it as a reference.
