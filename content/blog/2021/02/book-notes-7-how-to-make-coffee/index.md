 Short and sweet. A quick read that goes straight to the point.
 
 A **4-star** rating on [my GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186522-j-pedro-ribeiro).

Here are my _highlights_:

1. (...) they are made up of a soft fleshy exterior with a shell that hosts the seed that **we know as the coffee bean**. `(pg.21)`
1. Your nervous system receptors are constantly monitoring your level of _adenosine_, and when they get too high, your brain will slow down your neural activity and dilate the blood vessels, making you feel **sleepy** or crave rest. Caffeine has a similar molecular structure to _adenosine_ (...) meaning it can bind to your nervous system's adenosine receptors without activating them.`(pg.33)`
1. Once consumed, caffeine is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract and can remain in your system for between **6 and 8** hours. `(pg.34)`
1. Because it is both fat and water soluble, **caffeine passes easily** through the blood-brain barrier. `(pg.34)`
1. (on **Decaffeinated** methods) (...) beans are soaked for several hours in hot water, removing not only caffeine but also the oils and flavours. The beans are then separated from the water and the solvent is added to the water, again binding to the caffeine. The solvent is heated to evaporate together with caffeine. The water remaining is reused to process fresh batches of beans, but the beans and water now have the same balance of coffee oils and flavours. The process now removes only the caffeine from the beans(...).`(pg.48)`
1. If your coffee tastes a little **sour**; this is often due to **underextraction**. `(pg.69)`
1. (...) **bitter** coffee - this could be due to your beans, equipment, or brewing method, but it may also be caused by **overextraction**. `(pg.69)`
1. **Adjectives & intensifiers** for coffee: Crisp, bright, vibrant, tart. Muted, dull, mild. Wild, unbalanced, shard, pointed. Structured, balanced, rounded. Dense, deep, complex. Soft, faint, delicate. Juicy. Dry, astringent. Lingering, dirty. Quick, clean. `(pg.95)`
