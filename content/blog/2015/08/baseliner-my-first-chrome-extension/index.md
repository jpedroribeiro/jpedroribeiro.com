![Baseliner in action](images/baseliner-300x187.png) I've build a small tool a while ago to help me align elements on a page and keep the baseline consistent. It adds a customisable horizontal grid layer on top of any site whilst keeping the background content usable.

It started as a simple CSS snippet: `background` repeated every 8px. Later it became a JavaScript bookmarklet since I needed to run it frequently. Then, added some `input` fields to let me change the grid value dynamically.

Chrome it's one of my tools of choice when doing web development work. Using extensions too. Almost every front-end engineer has a range of extensions that are essential. Managing cookies, cache, enable/disable features, storage, etc. So moving this tool to an extension environment sounded like the next logical step.

It is a simple tool and it does the job it's meant to. Nothing more, nothing less.

You can find it at the Chrome Web Store, link is here: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/baseliner/agoopbiflnjadjfbhimhlmcbgmdgldld](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/baseliner/agoopbiflnjadjfbhimhlmcbgmdgldld)
