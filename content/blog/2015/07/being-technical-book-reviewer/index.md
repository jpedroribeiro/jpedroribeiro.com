title: "Being a Technical Book Reviewer"

A couple months ago I was approached by a book publishing company. They found this website through one of my [book review posts](http://jpedroribeiro.com/category/book-reviews/) and wanted me to be part of the **technical review** team of a new book they are releasing.

## Curiosity and challenge

I've been doing book reviews for a while and thought it sounded like a natural evolution for this 'hobby'. Without thinking twice I said yes.

The subject of the book was very close to me: **responsive web design** with [HTML5](http://jpedroribeiro.com/tag/html/) and [CSS3](http://jpedroribeiro.com/tag/css/). And it was aimed for beginners. Now, this changes things a little as you have to keep in mind the target audience.

## The learning curve

As a **technical reviewer** you have to make sure the code and techniques are on spot and make sense with the proposed topics. As we all know, there are a dozen ways of achieving the same outcome in **web development**, so you have to keep your personal preferences aside while reviewing someone else's work. And, being a book for beginners, you also have to suggest and indicate the easiest path to take whilst maintaining the reader interested.

## Job done

Eight chapters later and it was done.

It is more time consuming that you might think, but it's a very pleasant experience. There is so much to learn by reading other people's point of view on a subject and their approach to find a solution. And trying to make sure that that solution, not yours, works, it's challenging.

Gratifying experience. Hope to do more of that in the furure.

_PS: A new post will come as soon as the book is released._
