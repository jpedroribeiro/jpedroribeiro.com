For the past 2 years, my work has had a focus on delivering **fast experiences** on the web. I've also kept an eye on any article, tweet or [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/London-Web-Performance-Group/) that would mention performance. It was a job requirement back then, now it's something I'm quite passionate about.

## The Book

Which brings me to this [book](http://jpedroribeiro.com/category/book-reviews/), [Web Performance In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/web-performance-in-action), by [Jeremy L. Wagner](https://twitter.com/malchata). It's a very thorough collection of information on how to develop fast websites, from the best way to load **fonts** to techniques that cater for **HTTP/2**.

With my years of experience in this area I can honestly say that this book is more suitable for intermediate developers. If you are a beginner, you will still find plenty of tutorials to follow and implement without much effort - there are enough links to ready made solutions that will suit most scenarios and use cases. For an advanced user, it might be more of the same.

## Some Highlights

Right in the first chapters of the book, the author explain how to use **Chrome Dev Tools** to properly investigate **performance issues**. To me this was one of the highlights of the book. It's very well explained and give the readers a good set of tools to use throughout the book.

Another highlight was the chapter on [Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers). With [the news that Safari is intending to implement this technology](https://twitter.com/webmaxru/status/893027996659060738), it's good to see the effort in educating more developers about it.

But most of all, the **best chapter** in my opinion was the one regarding [HTTP/2](https://http2.github.io/). It manages to summarize a lot of information in a very easy to read manner. If you never heard of _header compression_, _head-of-line-blocking_, or _SSL_, then this is when you will become familiarized with these terms and understand the improvements this new version of the protocol is bringing the to web.
